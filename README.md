* Retrieve, add, edit, and delete problems from a living problem bank.
* Add and edit problem categories.
* Capability to associate solved problems with a student and vice versa; Capability to display solved problems by student and by problem.

## Getting Started
If you are completely new to git or would like a refresher, look at the provided tutorial and cheat sheet. Major milestones are available in the attached GitHub project, and tasks will be updated here regularly.

## Problem Bank
This portion should be entirely separate from the rest of the project. A page that utilizes databases to record practice problems and student info

[__Requirements__]: Due to the sensitive needs of the database, the problem bank and associated tables should be restricted to members of the Programming Team. As a resolution, a login feature could be implemented, or this part could be a standalone tool.

## Home

## About
A page that should inform the public about CSC both as a competition team and as a student organization. Team achievements, student spotlights, and competition information is provided on this page.
1. [__Header__]: Consists of an image gallery that cycles through images of the Programming Team; Include a revised CSC Mission Statement.
2. [__Advisor Blurb__]: A short blurb provided by Dr. Johnson about her outlook on teaching computer science.
3. [__Student Blurbs__]: An assortment of blurbs from current students about their respective experiences; Any CSC member is welcome to provide a blurb and picture to be listed on the website. Five to six student spotlights are optimal, but a gallery (implemented using arrow buttons) might be efficient without overcrowding the page.
4. [__Styling__]: Distinctive theme that blends with the overall color scheme and theme as well as group pictures.
