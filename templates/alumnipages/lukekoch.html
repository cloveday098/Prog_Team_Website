<p>How I got to MC: I started at PSCC and was connected with a Maryville recruiter through an honor society. I attended MC briefly before dropping out to do construction work. I came back to MC several years later.
<br><br>
At MC: I wanted to pivot from pure math toward cybersecurity but wasn't sure how to go about it. I took all the CS classes I could fit into my schedule while finishing my math B.A.:  computer architecture, operating systems, theory of computation, data analytics. Architecture and OS were especially helpful as they were based on building your own computer architecture and operating system at the time. They exposed me to low level problems like hexadecimal arithmetic and machine code. I did a SULI internship at ORNL with the cybersecurity group as a rising senior. My project involved writing binary instrumentation code for an AI system to use to bypass another AI system. I was able to turn that project into my year-long senior thesis. That work was eventually copyrighted and licensed to a startup. I graduated with a weird skill set: some math, some CS, and some statistics. Fortunately, that was a great foundation for a data science PhD, since that burgeoning field draws from math, CS, and statistics.
<br><br>
Current work: I work at the intersection of AI and cybersecurity. Data science is the academic field fueling the AI boom that seems to be all over the news. AI is not an existential threat, but it does accelerate the development of attacks and defenses, which means we as a nation need to find ways to improve and/or combat it.  I'm still finishing my Data Science PhD but recently joined ORNL as a staff member specializing in counter AI research.
<br><br>
Stuff you should know: The best preparation for cybersecurity is a deep knowledge of how computers work on a low level. Peeling away the abstraction that make computers easy to use lets you find vulnerabilities in unexpected places. The bulk of my work concerns file format manipulations, which allow me to hide malicious content or add benign camouflage. I spend a lot of time reading file format specifications and parsing program source code looking for little inconsistencies that I can exploit. I also study AI models, their feature sets, and feature importance metrics. You need to know which areas of the feature space a model considers important if you want to challenge it.
<br><br>
If you can't get your hands on low-level knowledge, focusing on mathematics/statistics is also valuable. Everything we do is at a large scale, which means we analyze vast amounts of data looking for patterns. The more math and statistics you know, the better you can analyze this data. Pure mathematicians, especially ones focused on analysis, are very useful to us when designing experiments or, more interestingly, demonstrating weaknesses in existing detection tools. Linear algebra is king since it makes the computational requirements of training AI feasible. If you want to understand AI you need to understand linear algebra. 
<br><br>
At the end of the day, it's not one single skill set that makes you a cybersecurity researcher. It's the ability to hammer away at a problem till it's solved. You won't see positive results for months at a time, but you must keep building your knowledge and experimenting till something works. Your attitude about a problem sometimes matters more than your skill at solving said problem. We have a ton of knowledgeable researchers at ORNL, but it's up to you to knock on their door and ask for advice. It's important for undergrads to put themselves in challenging situations so they can become accustomed to the stress and find their own ways of organizing/advancing their research.
<br><br>
You have to find something that matters to you more than the stress/frustration research can impose. For me, being a part of protecting the nation is that thing.  It's also never too early to find good mentors. Email scientists at the lab, ask about their research, ways to connect to opportunities. They love what they do and usually respond in a friendly manner, although they may be too busy to respond quickly. My group lead is a phenomenal mentor who has kept me sane when most other mentors would simply have piled on more stress. I've seen a few students have to start their PhD over because of a conflict with their mentor, so finding one that you trust and/or can communicate with is, in my opinion, very important if you plan to do a PhD.
